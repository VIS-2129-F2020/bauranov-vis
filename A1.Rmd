In this assignment, I will present how to use R markdown

## 1. Inserting code
Here, we'll see how to insert code. 

### 1.1 My first code looks like this:
```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
b <- 2
x*b
```
Success!

### 1.2. My second piece of code:
```{r}

for (val in x) {
  if (val %% 2 == 0)
    print(val*b)
}

```

## 2. Style in markdown

Markdown is a simple language that enables us to *make* **the text** neat.
You can also make lists in it:

1. This is the first ordered bullet,
2. And the second.

```{r}
print('This is the final piece of code')
hist(iris[[2]])

```

You can also write an inline code in R Markdown. For example, two plus two is **`r 2+2`**.
