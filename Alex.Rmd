## 1. Introduction - headers

We can create headers by placing 

### 1.1 You can create bold and italic text

For example *italic* uses two stars.
You can create bold by using **bold**, i.e. four stars.

```{r}

a <- 5
a+5
```
 
 You can also add inline code. We know that 2 + 2 is `r 2+2`
 
 
## 2. Section two - style and bullets

For exmaple in R Markdown, you can use lists as such:

1. This is the first element
2. This is the second element. 

``` {r}
print('This is another piece of code')

```

If you want to add TOC, you can do that like this:


## 3. Header 3

## 4 Header 4

This is some text in the H4

### 4.1 H41
